    __Ethical considerations__:
    We know it contains a lof of unfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral.

    __Model Card (by OpenAI)__:
    Because large-scale language models like GPT-2 do not distinguish fact from fiction, 
    we donâ€™t support use-cases that require the generated text to be true. Additionally, 
    language models like GPT-2 reflect the biases inherent to the systems they were trained on, 
    so we do not recommend that they be deployed into systems that interact with humans unless 
    the deployers first carry out a study of biases relevant to the intended use-case. We found 
    no statistically significant difference in gender, race, and religious bias probes between 
    774M and 1.5B, implying all versions of GPT-2 should be approached with similar levels of 
    caution around use cases that are sensitive to biases around human attributes.

    __Tech stack__:
    This website was built using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) and uses the awesome [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) framework to generate text.
